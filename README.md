# Cloud Sigma CLI (unofficial)

This is an attempt to create a CLI tool for the cloud sigma API. It is *extremely* influenced by the Digital Ocean CLI tool `doctl`, to the extent that much of the code is copied over from there.

This is nowhere near ready, but I wanted to learn golang, and this seemed like a fun project to do it with. I'm also hoping to author a version of k8s the hard way for cloud sigma, and it's basically pointless until there's a stable CLI to do the basic stuff (provision VMs, a load balancer, adjust firewall rules, etc).
